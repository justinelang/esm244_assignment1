## Data Overview

California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) has collected hydrographic and biological data on the California Current System since 1949. This data set includes a time-series of temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, silicate, nitrate/nitrite, and chlorophyll, among other observations (CalCOFI, n.d.). This analysis will explore the relationship between the O2 saturation of seawater off Californiaâ€™s coast and several physical and chemical variables.
